  Dialogue: 50 years ago, humanity founded its first colony on Mars. By that point,
    the massive buildup of space junk from numerous launches had become nearly unmanageable.
    So much technology left drifting in the vacuum of space. Since then, humanity
    has built many colonies across the solar system. At first, all of humanity united
    together, controlled the solar system, but as the years passed differences grew
    between the colonies. Eventually, factions emerged from the different colonies.
