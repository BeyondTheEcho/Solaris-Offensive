  Dialogue: "Admiral Stafford: \u201CI have no clue, every bit of information does
    not make sense. One second our forces were fine, the next they are being annihilated!
    Most of our fleet has been destroyed, and the rest are too damaged to continue
    a fight like this. Those who can are currently performing a fighting retreat
    back into the atmosphere or fleeing out of our gravity well\u201D"
