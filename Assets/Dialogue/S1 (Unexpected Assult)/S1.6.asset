  Dialogue: "\u201CWe\u2019re not sure what is happening yet. Incoming reports are
    scattered to say the least and contradictory at the worst. As best we can tell
    one second our forces were fine, the next they are being annihilated! Most of
    our fleet has been destroyed, and the rest are too damaged to continue a fight
    like this. Those who can are currently performing a fighting retreat back into
    the atmosphere or fleeing out of our gravity well\u201D"
